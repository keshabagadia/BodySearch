# ‚è≥ TIME LOOP ‚Äì Horror Narrative Prototype

**A work-in-progress interactive horror adventure** built using **Inky**, exploring a time loop narrative system. It is inspired by this japanese film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8yvXoyLPvM.

## üéÆ About the Project

You wake up in a familiar room. Again.

This interactive story is written in **Ink** and powered by **Inky**, Inkle Studios' scripting language for branching narrative.
## üìÅ How to Explore

1. **Download the folder:** `InkyDebugPrototype`
2. **Open the file:** `Day.ink`
3. Launch it using the [Inky editor](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).

This is an early-stage prototype. Things will probably break and there will probably be some typos that escaped me.

But, feedback is welcome. For questions or discussion, feel free to reach out.
